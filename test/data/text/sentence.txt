Everybody has a dream.
I have a dream,too.
I have a dream that one day I could become a math teacher.
I love math very much,because I think math is quite useful.
It's useful when people arebuying things.
It's useful when students are learning subjects like physics and chemistry.
And it's useful when scientists are doing experiments.
Teachers can not only help students to learn things but also teach the students to apply what they learn into practice.
Therefore,I hope to be a math teacher in the future.I want to help more students learn math.
