pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple gensim numpy scipy pandas transformers torch openpyxl nltk Pillow allennlp string re torchvision tabulate
```

## Installation

After downloading and installing dependencies, download this repository using the following command line:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lc451574367/Embedding
```

## How to run the codes

The python script `scripts_allstep.py` contains all functions.

## Note
The bert service is often cause misuse of BertClient in multi-thread/process environment. You canâ€™t reuse one BertClient among multiple threads/processes. If you want to use two different bert models in a row, you must close the current model after using it and then use the next one.
